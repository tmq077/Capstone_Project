### Problem Statement

In 2022, Singapore generated 813 million kg of food waste, accounting for 12% of total waste generated. Annually, each household throws away $258 worth of food, equivalent of 52 plates of nasi lemak (assuming each plate cost $5). The amount of food waste has grown by 30% over the past 10 years, and is expeced to rise further. At current rate of waste disposal, Singapore will need a new incineration plant every 7-10 years, and a new landfill every 30-35 years.

Households contribute around half of the food waste generated. As part of Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan, one key component of food waste management strategies is encouraging members of public to donate excess food. Organisations have specific wish list of food items and donation requirements, and it is time-consuming for individuals to find the right organisation for the food they wish to donate.

This project aims to explore how we can help link individuals up with organisations, by developing a chatbot for individuals to enquire about donating specific food items, and find out where and how to donate, along with the relevant donation instructions.

### Data Used

Data is saved from the website of various organisations that accept food donation, in PDF and html format. These are in [`webpages`](/code/webpages).

### Conclusion

- The RAG + GPT-3.5-Turbo model pipeline yields an answer relevancy of 0.97 and faithfulness of 0.87, indicating the model is able to generate concise and informative answers that are derived from the external dataset with minimal hallucations. 
- With this model pipeline, a chatbot is developed ([https://snack-o-meter.streamlit.app/](https://donatefoodgowhere.streamlit.app/)) to help individual food donors find the right organisations for donating their specific food items, along with additional donation information.

### Recommendations

#### 1 - Increase Public Awareness
- Through marketing campaigns (offline and online campaigns)​
#### 2 - Expand the model to include other snack types​
- For example: Nuts and chips
#### 3 - Integrate tool into HPB’s existing Health 365 app 
- Intergration is beneficial as it makes Health 365 as “one stop app”​

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

#### Estimated Cost (per year): $500,000

**1. Marketing Campaign for "Snack-O-Meter": $400,000**
   
The Nutri-Grade mark was officially launched on 30 Dec 2022. In FY2022, HPB spent $400,000 on programme, supplies & marketing.
Using this as a reference, it is expected that the marketing campaign for "Snack-O-Meter" will cost about the same.

**2. Application Development and Maintenance: $100,000**
   
The intention is for the "Snack-O-Meter" to be incorporated into HPB's existing application, the Health 365.
The advantage of integration (as opposed to building a standalone app) is that it would save cost on app development.
In addition, it also uses the Health 365 as a "one-stop" app for the public with regards to health matters.
Lastly, there would be no additional server cost required.

#### Estimated Benefit (per year): $12,840,000​

**3. Healthcare cost of metabolic risk: $642,000,000**
   
Research conducted in 2023 calculated that the healthcare cost arising from metabolic risks would amounted to S$642 million.
Metabolic risk in this study is defined by high systolic blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, high LDL cholesterol.
Consumption of sodium, sugar, and fat are positively correlated to the above metabolic risk.

From FY2017 to FY2019, the median sugar level of beverages decreased from 8.5 to 6.3 grams per 100 ml (25%).
This was attributed to the Nutri-Grade campaign which led to suppliers reducing sugar in their beverages.

According to Etiqa's Nutrition Survey conducted in 2022, most snackers would snack more than 3 times in a week.
Assuming a person consumed a serving of Hello Panda Chocolate a day, that would constitute about 8% of the daily average fats, sodium and sugar intake overall in Singapore.
If the sucess of the Nutri-Grade campaign (25% reduction) can be applied to "Snack-O-Meter", a 2% (25% * 8%) reduction in daily intake of fats, sodium, and sugar intake is expected.
Lastly, assuming that reduction in consumption of those nutrients of concern can directly impact metabolic risk by the same %, then a reduction of healthcare cost of $12,840,000 is expected.
